Starting with lab setup
1. Make sure that you are in your lab folder / GitHub repository that you created in the last lab.  and pull the latest changes using the command [HINT: git pull]
your repository will have a structure similar to the one below
Lab 1
lab1.java
lab1.class
README.md
README.md
2. Now, create a new folder Lab 2 inside this folder and your repo will have the below structure
Lab 1
lab1.java
README.md
Lab 2
lab2.java
README.md
README.md
3. The file lab2.java will have your lab 2 codes
4. The file README.md in Lab 2 folder will have the documentation consisting of the description of the program, working, output, constraints for the program and the validations perfromed.
5. After creating all these changes, make sure that you are committing the changes to GitHub and copy the commit URL as the submission [HINT: git add --all; git commit -m "commit message"; git push are the commands for your reference]

NOTE: Those who want to change the codes for Lab 1 can include their changes in this commit.


Lab Exercise Question
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name
Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.
Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!
